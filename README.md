This repository contains code from the Paquette Lab for performing RNA sequencing analysis of Craniosynostosis phenotypes. 

There are ten RMarkdown files that were each used for a different part of the analysis which include:

Combined Model- Filtering
Combined Model- Surrogate Variable Analysis and Voom Normalization
Combined Model- Differential Gene Expression

Female Model- Filtering
Female Model- Surrogate Variable Analysis and Voom Normalization
Female Model- Differential Gene Expression

Male Model- Filtering
Male Model- Surrogate Variable Analysis and Voom Normalization
Male Model- Differential Gene Expression

Comparison of Combined, Female, and Male Models
